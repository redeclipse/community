How to create a RE styled icon:
(more help is in the ReadMe of the texture file)

1. open all parts of "dominated_partX.svg" with GIMP
2. delete the black colours (colour to alpha)
3. make all parts to RE style
4. copy part1 into part3 (part1 level under part3)
5. make part3 to one level (not include the white image)
5. copy part2 into part3 (part2 level under part3)
6. mark the whole part2
6a. scroll the part2 upwards until it looks like in the "RE-dominated.svg" file (the straight line at the bottom must complete under the circle)
7. export as .png
