Name: Water Run
Mode: Race (Time Trial)
Creator: Iceflower
Status: WIP (finished: 99%)
Version: 535

About: Its a special race map because its not like "normal" that you walk on a solid ground, its here often water. The whole theme is water. Sometimes you can't see the way and a hidden place is there too.
Its not possible to go with head in lava, its fixed here (Thank you MaxPayne, who show me how to do it :D ) Routes: none (it would be vrey hard to add them)
Difficult: Not for beginners, more for advanced, which need good response and accuracy.

!!Note!!: There is a low version which is optical not as good as the normal version but has doubled fps!
