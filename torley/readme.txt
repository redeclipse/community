A sumptuous assortment of exquisite textures in a variety of styles, from surreal to sketchy to painterly to pixelated 'n' glitched-up — most are a challenge to describe but tend to provoke smiles.

All Torley Textures are 512x512 in (lossless) PNG format and seamlessly tiling. Use 'em almost however you want — just don't resell as-is — and let me know if you make somethin' kewl with 'em. You can also get them in Second Life @ http://torley.com/here
